7. Function Expression:-

The Javascript Function Expression is used to define a function inside any expression. The Function Expression
allows us to create an anonymous function that doesnâ€™t have any function name which is the main difference between
Function Expression and Function Declaration. A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked
Function Expression)which runs as soon as it is defined. A function expression has to be stored in a variable and
can be accessed using variableName.  With the ES6 features introducing Arrow Function, it becomes more easier to
declare function expression.


Anonymous Function besically Used Automatically call the Function.

Syntax:

( () => {
    // Function Body...
} )();
